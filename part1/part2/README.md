# Part 2

Congrats! You have reached the end of the test! :)
In this final part, we are going to test your creativity.

## Instructions

Create a CLI tool to interact with what you have built so far.
Some ideas could be:
- Feed your application with data (a JSON file)
- An user-friendly print of the output 
- Export output in different formats

Keep in mind that we are looking for clean, readable and robust code.
